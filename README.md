This program is a console application that receives, stores, and displays a customer's ID, name, and email. It uses the Customer structure to manage data, with the input and output functionalities handled by the inputCustomerData and printCustomerData functions, respectively. The program is structured into three separate files: Customer.h, Customer.cpp, and main.cpp.

1. Customer.h: This is the header file that contains the declarations related to the Customer structure and its associated functions. The Customer structure stores a customer's ID, name, and email, and the functions that interact with this structure are declared here.

2. Customer.cpp: This file contains the actual implementation of the functions declared in Customer.h. The inputCustomerData and printCustomerData functions handle the input and display of the customer's ID, name, and email in a formatted manner on the console.

3. main.cpp: This is the entry point of the program. It creates an object of the Customer structure, calls the inputCustomerData function to store user input in the object, and then calls the printCustomerData function to display the entered customer information on the screen.
